This example highlights a subtle but crucial aspect of Rust's borrowing system.  Attempting to modify a value through a mutable reference (`&mut`) after an immutable reference (`&`) has been created to the same value leads to a compile-time error.  This ensures memory safety and prevents data races.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly manage references to avoid this issue.
